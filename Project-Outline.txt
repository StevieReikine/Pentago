The goal of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to train an AI player for the two-person game Pentago.

Stages of the project: 

1. Write Two-Player version of Pentago. (Python 2.7)
2. Implement "dummy AI" player to play against. 
          Plays random moves. This is a place-holder player for more sophisticated AI algorithms.
3. Replace "dummy AI" with AI that uses Przemek's algorithm (BitBucket: https://bitbucket.org/przemekr/pentago)
    Note: This will require calling Przemek's function (in C++) from mine (Python). 
          SciPy seems to have tools to help do this, but this could be very tricky.
4. In TensorFlow, use DQN to train pentago AI to play against Przemek's algorithm. 
          Start the TensorFlow framework before ironing out everything with calling C++ functions from Python.

One day...
Play against super-solved Pentago server. 
If losing often, get permission to train with the data on the server.
