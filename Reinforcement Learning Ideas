How to reward?

Strategy 1: 
Positive reinforcement for:
-two, three, four, or five in a row
-blocking opponent?
      leave out in first pass

Negative for:
-opponent having 2, 3, 4 or 5 in a row

Weighted reinforcement? (as in more positive if more in a row?)

This could lead to a problem where local minima and will miss solutions of 2 + 2 on separate quads then winning with +1...


Strategy 2: 
-Reward (small) for each move not lost
-Huge reward for winning
-Huge penalty for losing
